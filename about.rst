Flanders Heritage Agency - Team Information
===========================================

`Flanders Heritage Agency <https://www.onroerenderfgoed.be>`_ is an agency of
the `Flemish Government <https://www.vlaanderen.be>`_ that deals with
immovable cultural heritage, broadly defined as archaeology, built heritage and
cultural landscapes.

The information team manages and creates information systems that support the
daily operations of the agency. While most of these systems are purely digital
systems these days, we also maintain the agency's library and it's archives. We
consider these an integral part of our information dissemination strategy.

When it comes to using, maintaining and building software, we invest heavily in
open source software. Until a few years ago we were a typical consumer of open
source software, without contributing much ourselves. A few years ago we
diverged from this path, created a `Github account 
<https://github.com/OnroerendErfgoed>`_ and started opening up software we had
written that might benefit other organisations dealing with cultural
heritage, other government agencies or anyone else interested in open source 
software. Have a look at our :ref:`projects` and see if there's anything that
benefits you..
