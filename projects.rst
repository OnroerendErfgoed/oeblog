Projects
========

Because we like sharing, we have made some of the technologies we use available
as open source software. A full list can be found on `Github
<https://github.com/OnroerendErfgoed>`_.

Applications
============

Some of the software we've written can be used a standalone application. Where
possible we have made sure they are easy to customise and adapt to your own
needs.

Atramhasis
----------

:pypi:`Atramhasis <atramhasis>` is a simple and friendly webbased `SKOS` 
editor. Written in Python, it's easy to install and customise.

Augeias
-------

:pypi:`Augeais` is a RESTful, webapplication written in Python that allows you 
to store digital objects in an object store. While it allows you to communicate 
with your objects as a service, it also decouples the storage implementation 
from the interface.

Uriregistry
-----------

:pypi:`Uriregisty <uriregistry>` is a simple Python application that tracks
where a certain `URI` is being used.


Libraries
=========

Apart from the complete applications, we have also developed a lot of libraries.
These are being used in our own applications and might be of use to you as well.

CRABpy
------

:pypi:`CRABpy <crabpy>` is a Python library to facilitate calls to the CRAB and
CAPAKEY services by `Informatie Vlaanderen <https://www.agiv.be>`_.

Language-tags
-------------

:pypi:`Language-tags <language-tags>` is a Python library for handling IANA 
Language Tags.
